## Georgia Tech Data Analytics Bootcamp - Module 3 Challenge
This assignment challenges us to two separate activities- PyBank and PyPoll. PyBank has us write a script to analyze financial data and output some information, such as the average change and the month which saw the greatest increase/decrease in profits. PyPoll has us write a script to analyze votes and output a winner for an election. Instructions can be found on our [Canvas](https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/2866/assignments/45790?module_item_id=845342).
